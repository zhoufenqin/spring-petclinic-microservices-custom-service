# Execute modernization plan

This skill is used to execute a modernization plan to migrate the a given project to Azure

## User Input

- modernization-description: The user intent to run the modernization plan
- modernization-work-folder (Mandatory): The folder to save the modernization plan
- programming-language: Input by user or autodetect by context

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding.

## Workflow

Given that modernization description, do this:
1. Read ${modernization-work-folder}/plan.md and you can have a overview with the modernization plan

2. Load all tasks from ${modernization-work-folder}/tasks.json and execute them one by one in the order they appear in the `tasks` array in tasks.json (do not reorder tasks):
    - Refer to the json schema tasks-schema.json to update the tasks.json
    - Before starting a task, update the tasks.json status to "started"
    - After completing a task, **YOU MUST** update the tasks.json status to "success", "failed", or "skipped" with a task summary and task successCriteriaStatus
    - Do not stop task execution until all tasks are completed or any task fails. If one task is started, wait for final result with success, skipped or failed.
    - Choose the right custom agent to execute the task based on the `type` field of the task in tasks.json, and call the custom agent with the prompt according to the task type and information in tasks.json. The custom agent will return the execution result including whether the task is successful, skipped or failed, and a summary of the execution.
        1) Custom agent usage to complete the infrastructure task:
        For tasks with `"type": "infrastructure"` in tasks.json, call custom agent `modernize-azure-platform-engineer` with prompt:

            ```md
            Generate IaC files to ./infra/ and provision Azure infrastructure.
            iacType: {iacType}
            provision: {provision}
            ```

        2) Custom agent usage to complete the coding task:
            1) You must call custom agent general-purpose for upgrade task of java with below prompt according to information from tasks.json, the upgrade task include java-version-upgrade, spring-boot-upgrade, spring-framework-upgrade and jakarta-ee-upgrade
                ```md
                Call skill execute-modernization-task to upgrade the X from {{v1}} to {{v2}} using java upgrade tools
                Here is the upgrade task details:
                - TaskId (from `id` field)
                - Description (from `description` field)
                - Requirements (from `requirements` field)
                - Environment Configuration (from `environmentConfiguration` field, may be null)
                - Success Criteria (from `successCriteria` field, includes: passBuild, generateNewUnitTests, generateNewIntegrationTests, passUnitTests, passIntegrationTests)
                - Exit Criteria: Ensure all code logic, configurations, support files and tests are properly migrated. Ensure both build and tests pass. Ensure the modernization is consistent (all expected goals are correctly implemented) and complete (all old technology references are fully removed or replaced).
                - modernization-work-folder: The folder to save the modernization summary
                ```
                {{v1}} and {{v2}} is the version and {{v2}} can be 'latest version' of it is not specified

            2) You must call custom agent general-purpose for transform task with below prompt according to information from tasks.json
                ```md
                Call skill execute-modernization-task to do the code change
                Here is the transform task details:
                - TaskId (from `id` field)
                - Description (from `description` field)
                - Requirements (from `requirements` field)
                - Migration Skills (The skill list from `skills` field used for migration if available, otherwise show `hint: <description of this task>`)
                - Environment Configuration (from `environmentConfiguration` field, may be null)
                - Success Criteria (from `successCriteria` field, includes: passBuild, generateNewUnitTests, generateNewIntegrationTests, passUnitTests, passIntegrationTests)
                - Exit Criteria: Ensure all code logic, configurations, support files and tests are properly migrated. Ensure both build and tests pass. Ensure the modernization is consistent (all expected goals are correctly implemented) and complete (all old technology references are fully removed or replaced).
                - modernization-work-folder: The folder to save the modernization plan from input
                ```

            3) Only use the skill execute-modernization-task in custom agent to do the code change for each task

        5. Custom agent usage to complete the security task:
            You must call custom agent general-purpose for security task with below prompt according to information from tasks.json
                ```md
                Call skill {{security-skill-for-the-task}} to do the security check and fix
                Here is the security task details:
                    - TaskId (from `id` field)
                    - Description (from `description` field)
                    - Requirements (from `requirements` field)
                    - Environment Configuration (from `environmentConfiguration` field, may be null)
                    - Success Criteria (from `successCriteria` field, includes: passBuild, generateNewUnitTests, generateNewIntegrationTests, passUnitTests, passIntegrationTests)
                    - modernization-work-folder: The folder to save the cve check report and fix summary      
                ```
        {{security-skill-for-the-task}} is resolved from the `skills` array in the security task in tasks.json. Each entry in `skills` is an object with `name` and `location` fields. If the task has multiple skills, combine all skill names into a single comma-separated list (e.g., `validate-cves-and-fix, additional-security-scan`). If there is only one skill, use its `name` value directly (e.g., `validate-cves-and-fix`).

        6. Custom agent usage to complete the integration test task:
        For tasks with `"type": "integrationTest"` in tasks.json, call custom agent `general-purpose` with prompt:
                ```md
                Call skill integration-tests to generate and run integration tests for the migrated project
                Here is the integration test task details:
                    - TaskId (from `id` field)
                    - Description (from `description` field)
                    - Requirements (from `requirements` field)
                    - Test Layers (from `layers` field, e.g., [1, 2] for Layer 1 and Layer 2)
                    - modernization-work-folder: The folder to save the modernization plan from input

                The integration-tests skill should:
                - For each layer in the layers array, run the integration-tests skill with that layer parameter
                - Layer 1: Generate Local Integration Tests with TestContainers for all Azure services
                - Layer 2: Generate Smoke Tests for basic application health checks
                - Ensure all tests pass before marking the task as successful
                ```
        7. Custom agent usage to complete containerization or deploy task:
        Custom agent modernize-azure-deploy-developer for containerization or deploy, call the agent with prompt with below format
                ```md
                Deploy the application to Azure
                ```
            or deploy to existing azure resources with below format if the plan.md contains the section of Azure Environment with Subscription ID and Resource Group:
                ```md
                Deploy the application to existing Azure resources. Subscription ID: {subscriptionId}, Resource Group: {resourceGroup}
    - You needn't generate any other documents except the "modernization-summary.md" for each task
    - **YOU MUST** update the tasks.json with the final status of each task (success, failed, or skipped)
    - Make a commit when all tasks are completed with the changes made in the modernization plan.            ```

7. Final verification before completing the plan:
   After all tasks have been executed, perform an overall verification:
   - **Consistency**: All expected modernization goals across all tasks are correctly and completely implemented
   - **Completeness**: All old technology references are fully removed or replaced — no partial remnants remain in source files, configuration files, build files, or test files
   - If any gap is found, re-execute the relevant task to address it before finalizing
